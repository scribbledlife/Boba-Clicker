# Boba-Clicker
This is a clicker style game, that I made, it is my first time ever coding, I had help from Gemini to help me debug different things. This is for the Horizons Hackclub qualifying hackathon project. 

I am still working on it, it isn't the best, but for me it is really good, becuase I am not that good at coding. Basically it is really similar to cookie clicker, but a the main idea is different.
